# Windsurf Project Rules

## General Principles
- Prioritize simplicity and readability
- Follow Python and Sugar style guides
- Use minimal dependencies
- Document complex or critical logic
- Write atomic, testable code

## Workflow
- Use atomic commits focused on a single concern
- Summarize objectives and context at session start; document progress at session end
- Ask for clarification if context is unclear

## Code Style & Formatting
- 2 spaces for indentation, 80-char line limits
- Use snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- Prefer named imports

## Project Structure
- Keep core logic in `sugargame/`
- Keep tests and examples in `test/`
