# App Flow Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the flow of the Sugargame application as of 2025-04-26.

### Current Flow
- **Initialization**: The main activity (see `TestActivity.py`) creates a `PygameCanvas` widget from the `sugargame` package.
- **Game Loop**: The Pygame main loop is run inside the Sugar activity context. The GTK event loop is pumped within the Pygame loop for integration.
- **Event Handling**: Input events are translated by `sugargame.event.Translator` and passed to the Pygame event system.
- **UI Integration**: Sugar toolbars/widgets can be added to the activity UI.
- **Persistence**: Hooks exist for saving/restoring state via the Sugar Journal.

### Key Files
- `sugargame/canvas.py`: Embeds Pygame into a GTK widget.
- `sugargame/event.py`: Handles event translation between GTK and Pygame.
- `test/TestActivity.py`: Example of integrating a game with Sugargame.

## Future Flow Considerations
- [ ] Add diagrams for state transitions
- [ ] Document custom toolbar/widget integration
- [ ] Expand on Journal persistence hooks
